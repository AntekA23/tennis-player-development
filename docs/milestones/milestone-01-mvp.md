**Status**: üü° IN PROGRESS (33% Complete)  
**Target Completion**: 2025-02-07  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-31

## Success Criteria

### Core User Workflow Must Work End-to-End
- [x] **Player Profile Management**: Player can create, edit, and view their tennis profile with data persistence ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Team Creation**: Player can create their own team and generate invite codes
- [ ] **Coach Invitation**: Coach can join player's team using invite code  
- [ ] **Parent Access**: Both parents can view and support child's tennis development

### User Validation Requirements  
- [x] **Real User Testing**: Actual tennis family (not just developers) successfully uses core features ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Multi-Role Testing**: Player, parent, and coach roles all work in practice
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: All user data survives system restarts and user sessions
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: System handles common user errors gracefully

### Technical Foundation Standards
- [x] **Database Reliability**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations and audit logging ‚úÖ
- [x] **Authentication Security**: Google OAuth with role-based access working ‚úÖ
- [ ] **API Completeness**: All core user actions supported by tRPC endpoints
- [ ] **UI Responsiveness**: Interface works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

#### Player Profile System (Complete - 2025-01-31)
- **User Value**: Tennis players can maintain comprehensive profiles with tennis and education data
- **Evidence**: User successfully created profile, data persists across sessions
- **Technical Achievement**: Fixed 4 critical bugs, established reliable data persistence
- **Reference**: [Progress Log 001](../progress/001-player-profile-system/)

### üîÑ In Progress Components

None currently in active development.

### ‚è≥ Pending Components

- **Technical Requirements**: Enable team.ts router, build team creation UI
- **Dependencies**: Player profiles (complete)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days

#### Coach Invitation System (Second Priority)  
- **User Value**: Simple way for players to add coaches to their teams
- **Technical Requirements**: ULID invite codes, redemption flow, coach onboarding
- **Dependencies**: Team management system
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### Parent-Child Account Linking (Third Priority)
- **User Value**: Parents can monitor and support child's tennis development  
- **Technical Requirements**: Parent dashboard, child access permissions
- **Dependencies**: Team management system for full value
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

## Evidence Package

### User Validation Evidence
- [x] **Player Profile**: User confirmed data saves and loads correctly across sessions
- [ ] **Team Workflow**: Pending - need player to create team and invite coach
- [ ] **Parent Access**: Pending - need parent to access child data successfully
- [ ] **Coach Experience**: Pending - need coach to join team via invitation

### Technical Evidence  
- [x] **Database Health**: PostgreSQL with proper audit logging and data integrity
- [x] **Authentication**: Google OAuth working in production environment
- [x] **API Reliability**: tRPC endpoints responding correctly with user data
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Systematic error scenario testing pending

### Performance Evidence
- [x] **Page Load Times**: Profile pages load in 1-2 seconds
- [x] **API Response Times**: tRPC queries respond in 100-300ms
- [ ] **Mobile Performance**: Mobile testing pending
- [ ] **Scale Testing**: Multi-user testing pending

## Lessons Learned (So Far)

### What's Working Well
- **Database-First Debugging**: Checking actual data in TablePlus reveals real issues faster than guessing
- **User as Client 0**: Using real user data makes testing authentic and catches real problems
- **Development Manifesto**: Strict discipline prevents scope creep and broken promises
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Screenshots and user testing provide undeniable proof of functionality

### What Could Be Improved
- **Earlier User Testing**: Could catch issues sooner with immediate validation after each change
- **Systematic Error Testing**: Need proper error scenario coverage
- **Mobile-First Development**: Should test mobile experience continuously, not as afterthought
- **Performance Monitoring**: Need baseline metrics before adding complexity

### Unexpected Discoveries
- **Drizzle ORM Quirks**: Some query methods work while others fail mysteriously
- **React Hook Timing**: Form population requires careful useEffect dependency management
- **Documentation Debt**: Extensive false claims in documentation that didn't match reality
- **Role-Based UX**: Users need explicit role selection for data access (not a bug)

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Status |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Team router enabling breaks player profiles | High | Medium | ‚è≥ Plan thorough testing |
| Coach invitation security vulnerabilities | High | Low | ‚è≥ Plan security review |
| Parent access permission confusion | Medium | Medium | ‚è≥ Plan clear UI design |
| Mobile responsiveness issues | Medium | High | ‚è≥ Plan mobile testing |

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Enable one feature at a time with immediate rollback capability
- **Family Testing**: Use real family (you, wife, coach) for authentic testing scenarios  
- **Security Review**: Audit all permission boundaries before parent access goes live
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish metrics before adding team management complexity

## Business Impact

### User Value Delivered
- **Immediate**: Tennis players can maintain comprehensive digital profiles
- **Foundation**: Reliable data storage enables all future team management features
- **Confidence**: Proves system can actually work as designed, not just promised

### Technical Value Created
- **Player Data Model**: Complete foundation for all future features
- **Authentication Infrastructure**: Secure, role-based access working in production
- **Development Process**: Manifesto and progress logging prevent future failures
- **Audit/Compliance**: Full data tracking for regulatory requirements

### Market Validation
- **User Adoption**: One family successfully using core features (small but real)
- **Problem-Solution Fit**: Player profile management addresses genuine need
- **Technical Feasibility**: Complex database relationships working reliably
- **Scalability Foundation**: Architecture supports multiple families/coaches

## Next Phase Planning

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)
1. **Enable Team Management**: Activate team.ts router, build team creation UI
2. **Generate Invite Codes**: Implement ULID-based invitation system
3. **Test Team Workflow**: User creates team, generates invite, verifies functionality

### Medium Term Goals (Week 2)
1. **Coach Invitation Flow**: Build invite redemption, coach onboarding experience
2. **Parent Dashboard**: Create parent access to child profiles and teams
3. **Multi-User Testing**: Test with actual family (player, parents, coach)

### Success Metrics for Milestone Completion
- [ ] Complete user workflow: Player creates team ‚Üí invites coach ‚Üí coach joins ‚Üí parents access
- [ ] All three user types successfully complete their core tasks
- [ ] Data integrity maintained across all user interactions
- [ ] System performs reliably under multi-user scenarios
