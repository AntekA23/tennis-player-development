# Migration Log: Add invite_code to teams table

**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Migration:** Add invite_code column to teams table  
**Environment:** Railway Production DB  

## Problem
- Teams table missing invite_code column
- Join team functionality broken due to missing database storage
- Invite codes only console.logged, not stored in DB

## Solution Applied

### 1. Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to teams table in src/db/schema.ts
invite_code: varchar("invite_code", { length: 32 }),
```

### 2. Migration Steps
1. **Modified schema** - Temporarily removed unique constraint
2. **Applied migration** - `npx drizzle-kit push --force`
3. **Status:** ✅ Successfully applied

### 3. Commands Executed
```bash
cd "C:\Users\bantc\Projects\tennis-player-development"
# Modified src/db/schema.ts to remove unique constraint temporarily
npx drizzle-kit push --force
# Result: [✓] Changes applied
```

## Validation Results ✅

### Database Structure Verified:
- ✅ **invite_code column exists** - Screenshot confirms varchar(32) column in teams table
- ✅ **Existing data preserved** - Both "Sonia Team" (NULL code) and "tmp_Sonia_Team" (TEAM564809) exist
- ✅ **New teams get codes** - "tmp_Sonia_Team" has invite_code: TEAM564809

### End-to-End Testing Verified:
- ✅ **Team creation works** - New team created with invite code stored in DB
- ✅ **Team join works** - User can join using invite code TEAM564809
- ✅ **Dashboard access** - User successfully reaches team dashboard after joining
- ✅ **Database lookup** - Join API successfully finds team by invite_code

### Evidence Attached:
- Screenshot 1: team_members table showing successful joins
- Screenshot 2: teams table showing invite_code column and data
- Screenshot 3: Team dashboard showing successful team access
- Screenshot 4: Team onboarding UI showing invite code flow

### Schema Validation Script
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-schema.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. **Visual DB verification** - Screenshot required
2. **Populate existing teams** - Add invite codes to teams without them  
3. **End-to-end testing** - Create team → join team flow
4. **Add back unique constraint** - Once all teams have codes
