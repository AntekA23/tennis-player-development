## 🎯 Coach Workflow Testing

### Weekly Planning Scenario
1. **Coach opens app on phone** → Should default to list view
2. **Navigate to this week** → TODAY button should be highlighted
3. **Filter to practices only** → Should show 3 practice events
4. **Expand practice card** → Quick actions should be visible
5. **Reschedule practice** → Modal should open with quick options

**Expected Result:** Complete workflow in <30 seconds

### On-Court Quick Reschedule
1. **Coach receives weather alert** → Needs to move practice quickly
2. **Find event in today's list** → Should be at top, clearly marked
3. **Tap reschedule** → Modal opens immediately
4. **Tap "Tomorrow"** → Event moves, success message shows

**Expected Result:** Reschedule complete in <10 seconds

### Multi-Week Navigation
1. **Coach planning next month** → Navigate to week +3
2. **Clone recurring practice** → Should duplicate with same details
3. **Return to current week** → TODAY button should reset view

**Expected Result:** Navigation smooth, no performance issues
