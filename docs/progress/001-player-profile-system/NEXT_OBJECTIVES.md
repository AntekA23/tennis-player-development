# Player Profile System - Next Objectives

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Critical Path Features
These features directly build on the current advancement and should be tackled next:

1. **Team Management System**
   - **User Value**: Players can create their own teams and manage their development network
   - **Technical Dependency**: Builds on player profiles - teams are owned by players, not coaches
   - **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days (enable team routers, create UI, test workflows)
   - **Success Criteria**: Player can create team, generate invite codes, see team roster

2. **Coach Invitation System**
   - **User Value**: Players can invite coaches to join their teams using simple invite codes
   - **Technical Dependency**: Requires team management system and ULID invite code generation
   - **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days (invite generation, redemption flow, coach onboarding)
   - **Success Criteria**: Coach can use invite code to join player's team successfully

3. **Parent-Child Account Linking**
   - **User Value**: Parents can view and support their child's tennis development
   - **Technical Dependency**: Uses existing parent_child_relations table and permissions system
   - **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days (parent dashboard, linking UI, age verification)
   - **Success Criteria**: Both parents can access child's profile and team information

### Priority 2: Supporting Features
These features enhance the current advancement but aren't critical path:

- **Profile Photo Upload**: Visual identity for player profiles
- **Profile Export/Share**: Generate PDF reports of player progress
- **Data Import**: Import existing tennis data from other systems
- **Profile Templates**: Pre-filled profiles for different player types

### Priority 3: Nice-to-Have Enhancements
These features would be valuable but can wait:

- **Social Features**: Connect with other players in the system
- **Progress Analytics**: Charts and graphs of development over time
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience for profile management
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with tournament management systems

## Technical Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Needs
- **Database Changes**: No schema changes needed - existing tables support team management
- **API Endpoints**: Enable disabled tRPC routers (team.ts.disabled → team.ts)
- **Authentication**: Role-based access already working, may need permission refinements
- **UI Components**: Team creation forms, invite code display, parent dashboards

### Code Dependencies
- **Enable Disabled Routers**: team.ts, training.ts, auth.ts currently disabled due to schema issues
- **ULID Library Integration**: Already configured, need to implement invite code generation
- **Email Integration**: For sending invite codes (can start with copy/paste)
- **File Upload**: For future profile photos (not immediate priority)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Team router enabling breaks existing functionality | High | Medium | Test thoroughly in isolation, maintain rollback plan |
| Invite code security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Use time-limited codes, proper validation, audit logging |
| Parent-child linking permission confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear UI indicators, comprehensive testing with real families |

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration Risk**: Low - existing schema supports planned features
- **Breaking Changes Risk**: Medium - enabling disabled routers might reveal integration issues
- **Performance Risk**: Low - team management shouldn't significantly impact performance
- **Security Risk**: Medium - invite codes and parent access need careful permission handling

### Product Risks
- **User Adoption Risk**: Low - features directly address core user needs (Sonia's family)
- **Complexity Risk**: Medium - multiple user types (player/parent/coach) increase UI complexity
- **Scope Creep Risk**: High - team management could expand into complex scheduling features

## Success Metrics

### User-Facing Metrics
- **Functionality**: All three user types (player/parent/coach) can complete their core workflows
- **Usability**: User can complete team creation and coach invitation in <5 minutes
- **Performance**: Team management pages load in <2 seconds
- **Reliability**: Team invitations work 100% of the time when following proper workflow

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Quality**: All TypeScript compilation passes, no linting violations
- **Test Coverage**: At least one end-to-end test for each user workflow
- **Documentation**: All user workflows documented with screenshots
- **Security**: All parent-child access properly audited and logged

## Development Approach

### Recommended Methodology
1. **Planning Phase**: Enable team router and verify existing schema compatibility
2. **Implementation Phase**: Build one user workflow at a time (player → coach → parent)
3. **Testing Phase**: Test each workflow with real family (you, your wife, mock coach)
4. **Deployment Phase**: Gradual rollout with immediate rollback capability

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Design Review**: Team management UI mockups validated with users
- [ ] **Code Review**: Router enabling doesn't break existing player profiles
- [ ] **User Testing**: Complete workflows tested by actual family members
- [ ] **Security Review**: Parent access permissions properly restricted
- [ ] **Performance Review**: No regressions in player profile loading times

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Estimated Hours**: 20-25 hours total for all three priority features
- **Critical Path Duration**: 7-10 days for users to get full team management value
- **Testing Time**: 5-8 hours for comprehensive workflow validation
- **Documentation Time**: 3-4 hours for progress logs and user guides

### External Dependencies
- **User Availability**: Need family testing for parent-child workflows (2-3 hours)
- **Coach Testing**: Need at least one real coach to test invitation system (1 hour)
- **Infrastructure**: No new infrastructure needs - Railway deployment sufficient

## User Stories Impact

### Enabled User Stories
These user stories will become possible after the next advancement:
- **US-003**: "As a player, I want to create my team and invite coaches" → Fully achievable
- **US-004**: "As parents, we want dual access to our daughter's tennis information" → Fully achievable
- **US-007**: "As a coach, I want to join player teams via invitation" → Fully achievable
- **US-008**: "As a coach, I want to coordinate with other coaches" → Basic version achievable

### Enhanced User Stories
These existing user stories will be improved:
- **US-001**: Player profiles become more valuable when part of team context
- **US-002**: Education tracking becomes more valuable when parents can monitor

## Documentation Updates Needed

### User-Facing Documentation
- [ ] **README.md**: Update to reflect team management capabilities
- [ ] **User Guide**: Create step-by-step guides for each user type
- [ ] **Coach Onboarding**: Instructions for coaches joining teams

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Update to reflect working team management system
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Document team relationships and invite code system
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Document team management tRPC endpoints

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **What to Communicate**: "Player profiles working, now building team management"
- **When to Communicate**: After each major user workflow is complete
- **How to Communicate**: Progress logs with evidence and user validation

### User Communication
- **Feature Announcements**: "You can now create teams and invite coaches"
- **Training Needs**: Simple workflows - should be intuitive for tennis families
- **Feedback Collection**: Direct testing with your family and coach network
