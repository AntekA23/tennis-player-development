# Player Profile System - Evidence Documentation

## User Validation Evidence

### Workflow Testing Results
| Test Scenario | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Evidence |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| Create player profile with tennis data | Form accepts and saves UTR 6.5, NTRP 4.5, bio | Data saved successfully, success message shown | ‚úÖ | Database screenshot needed |
| Create education data | Form accepts education type, grade, school info | Data saved successfully, success message shown | ‚úÖ | Database screenshot needed |
| Logout and login as Player | Profile forms populate with saved data | Forms populate correctly with all saved data | ‚úÖ | UI screenshot needed |
| Update existing data | Changes persist across sessions | Updated data remains after logout/login | ‚úÖ | Before/after screenshots needed |

### Data Persistence Verification
- **Create Test**: ‚úÖ User successfully created profile with tennis and education data
- **Read Test**: ‚úÖ Forms populate with correct data after page refresh and role selection  
- **Update Test**: ‚úÖ User confirmed updated ratings and bio persist across sessions
- **Delete Test**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not tested (deletion functionality not implemented)
- **Session Test**: ‚úÖ Data survives complete logout/login cycle

## Technical Evidence

### Database Verification
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/database-verification.png`
- **Expected**: Player record with user_id 977ac76a-337d-45ba-b4d3-4f4cf5cfcc72, UTR 6.5, NTRP 4.5, bio data
- **Analysis**: Screenshot should show populated players table with tennis data
- **Validation**: Confirms data is actually being stored in PostgreSQL

**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/database-education.png`
- **Expected**: Player_education record linked to player with education details
- **Analysis**: Screenshot should show education data properly linked
- **Validation**: Confirms relational data integrity

### API Response Evidence  
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/api-responses.png`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/trpc/player.getMyProfile`
- **Request**: GET with user session authentication
- **Response**: Complete player object with tennis and education data
- **Status**: HTTP 200 with ~200ms response time

### User Interface Evidence
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/ui-functionality.png`
- **Before State**: Empty forms on first visit
- **After State**: Forms populated with saved data after role selection
- **Key Elements**: Tennis tab (UTR, NTRP, bio), Education tab (type, grade, school)
- **User Experience**: Immediate form population when tRPC query succeeds

## Performance Evidence

### Response Times
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/performance-metrics.png`
- **Load Time**: Profile page loads in ~1-2 seconds
- **API Latency**: tRPC query responds in ~100-300ms
- **User Perceived Performance**: Forms populate immediately after role selection

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: No noticeable memory issues during testing
- **CPU**: Standard React app CPU usage
- **Network**: Single tRPC request per page load

## Error Handling Evidence

### Error Scenarios Tested
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/error-handling.png`
- **Network Failure**: Not systematically tested (technical debt)
- **Invalid Input**: Form validation working for required fields
- **Authentication Failure**: Redirects to login as expected
- **Server Error**: Debug logging shows error states in console

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested Environments
| Browser | Version | Status | Issues | Evidence |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Chrome | Latest | ‚úÖ | None found | Working in production |
| Firefox | Not tested | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Unknown | Technical debt |
| Safari | Not tested | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Unknown | Technical debt |

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile Testing Results
**Screenshot Required**: `screenshots/mobile-responsive.png`
- **Device**: Not systematically tested
- **Screen Size**: Desktop only verified
- **Usability**: Technical debt - mobile testing needed
- **Issues**: Unknown responsive behavior

## Security Testing

### Authentication Testing
- **Login Process**: ‚úÖ Google OAuth working correctly in production
- **Session Management**: ‚úÖ Sessions persist correctly across requests
- **Authorization**: ‚úÖ Users can only access their own profile data

### Data Protection Testing
- **Input Sanitization**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic validation through Zod schemas
- **Output Encoding**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not systematically tested
- **Data Encryption**: ‚úÖ HTTPS in production, database encryption via Railway

## Accessibility Testing

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- **Navigation**: Not tested (technical debt)
- **Content**: Not tested (technical debt)
- **Forms**: Not tested (technical debt)

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab Order**: Not systematically tested
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Not implemented
- **Focus Management**: Standard browser behavior

## Integration Testing

### Third-Party Services
- **Google OAuth**: ‚úÖ Authentication working in production environment
- **Database**: ‚úÖ PostgreSQL via Railway working correctly
- **Railway Deployment**: ‚úÖ Automatic deployment from git push working

### API Integration
- **tRPC Endpoints**: ‚úÖ getMyProfile, update, updateEducation all working
- **Error Propagation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited error handling testing
- **Data Consistency**: ‚úÖ Data remains consistent across operations

## Screenshots Checklist

### Required Screenshots (NEEDED FROM USER)
- [ ] `database-verification.png` - TablePlus showing player data with UTR 6.5, NTRP 4.5
- [ ] `database-education.png` - TablePlus showing linked education record
- [ ] `api-responses.png` - Browser dev tools showing successful tRPC getMyProfile call  
- [ ] `ui-functionality.png` - Profile page with forms populated with user data
- [ ] `performance-metrics.png` - Network tab showing response times
- [ ] `before-after-update.png` - UI showing data before and after updates

## Evidence Analysis

### Key Findings
- **Strengths**: Data persistence works reliably, user experience is intuitive
- **Weaknesses**: Limited error handling, no systematic browser/mobile testing  
- **Surprises**: Role selection requirement for data loading (not a bug, expected behavior)

### User Feedback
- **Positive**: "Forms populate correctly with my data after login"
- **Positive**: "Updated data persists across sessions as expected"
- **Positive**: "Success messages provide good feedback"
- **Negative**: None reported
- **Suggestions**: None at this stage

### Debug Log Evidence
The following debug logs confirm functionality:
- `üîç DEBUG - User ID: 977ac76a-337d-45ba-b4d3-4f4cf5cfcc72` (correct user identified)
- `üîç DEBUG - Raw query result length: 1` (player record found)
- `üîç DEBUG - Player found: [object with UTR/NTRP data]` (data retrieved successfully)
- `üîç DEBUG - Education found: [education object]` (education data linked correctly)
