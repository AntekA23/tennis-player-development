# Progress Logging System

This folder tracks major functional advancements in the tennis career platform development. Each advancement gets its own numbered folder with standardized documentation.

## Purpose

- **Historical Record**: Document what was actually accomplished vs planned
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: Prove functionality works with user testing
- **Learning Capture**: Record both successes and failures for future reference
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Show concrete progress with evidence

## Folder Structure

```
progress/
├── README.md (this file)
├── TEMPLATE-*.md (reusable templates)
└── 001-feature-name/
    ├── SUMMARY.md (what was accomplished)
    ├── TECHNICAL.md (bugs fixed, code changes)
    ├── EVIDENCE.md (screenshots, tests, validation)
    └── NEXT_OBJECTIVES.md (suggested next steps)
```

## Naming Convention

### Folders
- `001-feature-name/` - Zero-padded numbers for chronological order
- Use kebab-case for feature names
- One folder per major functional advancement

### Screenshots
- Save in `screenshots/` subfolder within each progress folder
- Use descriptive names: `database-player-data.png`, `profile-forms-populated.png`
- Include date if multiple versions: `2025-01-31-profile-working.png`

## What Qualifies as "Major Advancement"

✅ **Include These:**
- First working implementation of a core user workflow
- Resolution of critical blocking bugs that enable new functionality
- Completion of user stories that deliver end-to-end value
- System components that users can interact with successfully

❌ **Don't Log These:**
- Code refactoring without user-visible changes
- Documentation updates alone
- Small bug fixes that don't enable new features
- Work-in-progress that isn't user-testable

## Process

### Automated (Claude Handles)
1. **Create folder structure** after major advancement completion
2. **Write all markdown files** with technical details and analysis
3. **Generate next objectives** based on current system state
4. **Update cross-references** to other documentation

### Manual (User Provides)
1. **Take requested screenshots** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Save in specified location** with correct naming
3. **Confirm functionality works** as documented

## Integration with Manifesto

Each progress log must demonstrate compliance with the [Development Manifesto](../DEVELOPMENT_MANIFESTO.md):

- ✅ **Evidence-Based Progress**: User validation of working functionality
- ✅ **Single Feature Focus**: Complete one thing fully before proceeding
- ✅ **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate testing of changes
- ✅ **No Broken Promises**: Only document what actually works

## Templates

Use the provided templates to ensure consistency:
- `TEMPLATE-SUMMARY.md` - What was accomplished (user-facing value)
- `TEMPLATE-TECHNICAL.md` - How it was built (developer details)
- `TEMPLATE-EVIDENCE.md` - Proof it works (screenshots, tests)
- `TEMPLATE-NEXT_OBJECTIVES.md` - What should be built next

## Maintenance

- Update progress logs if functionality changes significantly
- Cross-reference with git commits and deployment history
- Archive old evidence if functionality is rebuilt
- Maintain links to related ADRs and checkpoints

**Remember**: Progress logs capture reality, not intentions. Only document what has been user-validated and proven to work.
