# Session Break Status - Windows Restart
**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Break Type**: Windows machine restart  
**Expected Return**: Few hours

## 🎯 Current Status Summary

### ✅ **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: CI Guardrails v1**
- **Engineering discipline layer is FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Git tag `ci-guardrails-v1` successfully pushed to origin
- All quality gates working: Husky hooks, GitHub Actions CI, zero warnings policy

### 🔧 **Technical Status**
- **Main Branch**: Clean and green with all CI passing
- **Last Successful Build**: Pre-push hook executed perfectly before tag push
- **Quality Gates**: All active (lint, typecheck, build, LOC limits)
- **Database**: Stable - migrations synced and working
- **Deployment**: Railway.com deployment working correctly

### 📋 **Next Session Priority**
**CRITICAL**: The player profile data persistence bug is still UNRESOLVED

**Background**: User confirmed multiple times that player profile data (tennis & education) is not persisting/displaying after page refresh. This is the core blocking issue.

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Session role population on page refresh
2. tRPC query execution with proper session context
3. Database query results vs UI display logic
4. useEffect dependency array for profile data loading

## 🚨 **MANDATORY: Resume Protocol**

When Claude returns after Windows restart:

1. **DO NOT** start new features or improvements
2. **FOCUS IMMEDIATELY** on the player profile persistence bug
3. **Test with user** within 30 minutes of starting work
4. **Follow o3's micro-approach**: small, testable changes only

## 📁 **Key Files for Bug Investigation**
- `src/app/dashboard/player/profile/page.tsx` - Frontend profile form
- `src/server/api/routers/player.ts` - Backend player queries  
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Session role population
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` - Session type definitions

## 🛠 **Engineering Discipline Status**
- **Husky Pre-commit**: ✅ Active (lint, typecheck, LOC limits)
- **Husky Pre-push**: ✅ Active (full quality gates)
- **GitHub Actions CI**: ✅ Active on all branches  
- **Zero Warnings Policy**: ✅ Enforced globally
- **Vitest Infrastructure**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Structured Logging**: ✅ Implemented throughout

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Next Session**
1. User can fill player profile (tennis + education tabs)
2. User logs out and back in 
3. Profile data displays correctly on page refresh
4. User confirms: "Profile data persistence is working"

## ⚠️ **Critical Reminders**
- **NO NEW FEATURES** until profile persistence works
- **User testing required** for any claimed fixes
- **Follow manifesto principles** - single focus, evidence-based
- **Micro-changes only** - test each small change immediately
