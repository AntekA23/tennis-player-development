# Development Retrospectives

This folder contains retrospective analyses of completed work, capturing lessons learned and process improvements for future development cycles.

## Purpose

- **Learning Capture**: Document what worked well and what could be improved
- **Process Evolution**: Identify patterns that lead to success or failure
- **Team Development**: Share insights across development sessions
- **Stakeholder Value**: Show continuous improvement and maturity

## Retrospective Types

### Feature Retrospectives
- **When**: After completing major user-facing features
- **Focus**: User experience, technical implementation, collaboration effectiveness
- **Audience**: Development team and product stakeholders

### Sprint Retrospectives  
- **When**: After significant development periods (weekly/bi-weekly)
- **Focus**: Development process, velocity, blocking issues
- **Audience**: Development team

### Milestone Retrospectives
- **When**: After achieving major project milestones
- **Focus**: Strategic learnings, market validation, product direction
- **Audience**: All stakeholders including investors

### Crisis Retrospectives
- **When**: After resolving major issues or failures
- **Focus**: Root cause analysis, prevention strategies, emergency response
- **Audience**: Development team and affected stakeholders

## Retrospective Structure

### What Went Well (Successes)
- **Processes** that accelerated development
- **Tools** that proved valuable
- **Decisions** that had positive impact
- **Collaboration patterns** that worked effectively

### What Could Be Improved (Opportunities)
- **Processes** that slowed development
- **Tools** that caused friction
- **Decisions** that had negative consequences
- **Communication gaps** that caused confusion

### Action Items (Improvements)
- **Specific changes** to implement in future work
- **Process modifications** to increase effectiveness
- **Tool changes** or additions to consider
- **Communication improvements** to adopt

### Key Learnings (Insights)
- **Technical discoveries** that change understanding
- **User insights** that affect product direction
- **Market learnings** that influence strategy
- **Team insights** that improve collaboration

## Retrospective Timing

### Regular Schedule
- **Weekly Mini-Retros**: Quick process check during active development
- **Feature Completion Retros**: After each major user workflow is complete
- **Monthly Strategic Retros**: Broader product and process review
- **Milestone Retros**: After major project achievements

### Event-Driven Retros
- **Crisis Response**: After resolving blocking issues
- **User Feedback**: After significant user testing sessions  
- **Technical Breakthroughs**: After solving complex technical challenges
- **Process Failures**: When established processes don't work

## Integration with Other Documentation

### Progress Logs
- Retrospectives reference specific progress logs for detailed context
- Progress logs capture immediate learnings, retros synthesize patterns
- Action items from retros influence future progress log formats

### Milestones
- Milestone retrospectives summarize learnings across multiple features
- Strategic insights from retros inform future milestone planning
- Success patterns identified in retros guide milestone success criteria

### Manifesto Evolution
- Retrospectives evaluate manifesto compliance and effectiveness
- Process improvements from retros may update manifesto principles
- Retro action items often become new manifesto practices

## Retrospective Facilitation

### Preparation
1. **Gather Data**: Review progress logs, user feedback, technical metrics
2. **Set Context**: Define time period and scope for retrospective
3. **Invite Participants**: Include all relevant stakeholders
4. **Prepare Questions**: Tailor questions to retrospective focus

### Facilitation Process
1. **Set Stage**: Review purpose, timeline, and ground rules
2. **Gather Data**: Collect what went well and improvement opportunities
3. **Generate Insights**: Identify patterns and root causes
4. **Decide Actions**: Select specific improvements to implement
5. **Close**: Summarize key learnings and next steps

### Follow-Up
1. **Document Results**: Create retrospective record in this folder
2. **Track Actions**: Monitor implementation of improvement actions
3. **Share Learnings**: Communicate insights to broader team/stakeholders
4. **Evaluate Impact**: Assess whether improvements actually help

## Templates
